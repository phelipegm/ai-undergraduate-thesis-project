## Objective

To perform an experimental comparison between algorithms of machine learning that follow a traditional approach with algorithms based on Deep Learning (deep learning) in order to solve the fake news identification problem. Four models will be trained using the machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory.

## Dataset

The dataset was first created by Maciej Szpakowski (https://github.com/several27), but I have changed a little bit in order to only leave 'REAL' and 'FAKE' labels as the original one has many others. The table below shows the structure of the databases that were used. Three versions were produced that were classified as small, medium and large:

You can find the datasets to use on this project in the following folder on Google Drive:
