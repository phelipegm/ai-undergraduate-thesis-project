# [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Artificial Intelligence Undergraduate Thesis Project

## Title

A comparative experimental analysis of traditional approaches and deep learning based for fake news identification

</pre>

## Objective

To realize practical experiments to compare the performance of techniques based in SVM and Naive Bayes, which needs preprocessing of the entry data, with those based in deep learning for fake news dataset classification.

## Dataset

The dataset was first created by Maciej Szpakowski (https://github.com/several27), but I have changed a little bit in order to only leave 'REAL' and 'FAKE' labels. The file it is about 8GB.

Because the dataset is too big, while the thesis is not on its final version I'm using the dataset created by George McIntire (https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire). It is about 30 MB.
