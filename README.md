# [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Artificial Intelligence Undergraduate Thesis Project

## Title

A comparative experimental analysis of traditional approaches and deep learning based for fake news identification

</pre>

## Objective

To realize practical experiments to compare the performance of techniques based in SVM and Naive Bayes, which needs preprocessing of the entry data, with those based in deep learning for fake news dataset classification.

## Dataset

The dataset was created by Maciej Szpakowski (https://github.com/several27), it is currently hosted on a public S3 bucket and is about 9.1GB in size.

</pre>

Because the dataset is too big, while the thesis is not on its final version I'm using the dataset created by George McIntire (https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire). It is about 30 MB.
